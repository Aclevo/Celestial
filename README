**This is the official base source code of Celestial Linux**
It uses buildroot-2025.02.5.

To build, install gcc, g++, and make to build from source.

in the command line, navigate to the buildroot folder, and run:

'''
make menuconfig
'''

This will allow you to play around with the base system before you build it. We recommend you save a working version before adding/subtraction features.
